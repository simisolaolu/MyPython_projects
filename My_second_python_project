#13. Matrix Builder with Pattern
# Context Building structured 2D data requires nested loops and careful calculation.
# Requirements

# 1. Create an empty list called matrix.

matrix = []
#range 4 is (0,1,2,3)
# for row in range(4):
#     current_row = []
#     for col in range(5):
#         current_row.append((row * 5) + col)
#     matrix.append(current_row)
#     print(current_row)
    
# Goal: Write a for loop that iterates from 1 to 10. Inside the loop, use an if/else statement to check:

# If the number is even, print "[Number] is even."

# If the number is odd, print "[Number] is odd."

# Hint: Use the modulo operator (%) to check for even/odd. An even number divided by 2 has a remainder of 0.

even = []
odd = []

# for number in range(1,11):
#     if number % 2 == 0:
#         even.append(number)
#         print(f"{number} is even.")
#     else:
#         odd.append(number)
#         print(f"{number} is odd.")

# print(f"{odd} are odd.")
# print(f"{even} are even.")
  

# 1. Start-up banner
# Print the line below when the programme starts:

# Astronomy Observation Log

print("astronomy observation log")

#2. Capture a single observation
#Create two variables, then print a one-line summary.

#Create target_name and seeing_score

    average_count = total / count
# print(total) # check my code
# print(count) # check my code
# Print both the original list and the average:
print(f"{star_counts}\n {average_count}")

# 4. Loop over observations
# Use a loop to produce structured lines

# Reuse star_counts from Task 3

for star in star_counts:
    total_stars = star + total

    print(f"Night 1: {star} stars")

#After the loop, print the total number of stars counted across all nights using a running total you computed in the loop
print(f"Total star observed: {total}")

#5. Build a simple report string with a loop
#Create a single multi-line string from a list, using a loop only.

#Starting from star_counts, create a string named report that looks exactly like this when printed:#

#. Dictionary record with nested list
# Store structured session data in a dictionary, then compute an average using only values retrieved from
# that dictionary.

#Create a dictionary named session_record with these keys and values:

    "observer": "Riley",
    "session_id": 90314, #(an integer)
    "magnitudes": [2.1, 1.8, 2.4, 1.9, 2.2] # (a list of floats)
}
#print(session_record["magnitudes"])
#average_magnitude = total / count

count = 0

    total = mag + total
    count = count + 1
    average_magnitude = total/count
print(average_magnitude)

#Print the three-line report below using only values accessed from session_record:

#print(f" observer: {session_record["observer"]}\n Session ID: {session_record["session_id"]}\n Average magnitude: {average_magnitude:.2f}")
print(f" Observer: {session_record["observer"]}")
print(f"Session ID: {session_record["session_id"]}")
